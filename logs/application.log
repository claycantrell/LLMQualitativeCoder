Your task is to segment this text into discrete, self-contained "meaning units." Each meaning unit must be a direct, unaltered quote from the speaker.

Each segment can be a full sentence, phrase, or brief passage that conveys one idea completely.\n\n3. **Direct Quotes Only – No Changes**: Each meaning unit must use the speaker’s exact words without any alteration. Do not modify, change, summarize, or rephrase.\n\n4. **Preserve Original Language**: Do not change the language in any way – keep the original words as they are.\n\n5. **Do Not Interpret or Simplify**: Simply segment into distinct quotes without adding interpretation or simplification.\n\n6. **Incorporate Metadata**: Use all provided metadata to inform your segmentation. Metadata may include, but is not limited to, speaker identifiers, context details, and other relevant information.\n\n7. **Avoid Over-Segmentation**: Do not create overly short fragments unless a few words alone carry complete meaning.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nStructure the output in JSON format, following these keys:\n\n- `"quote"`: The exact words of the segmented meaning unit.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\n```json\n[\n  { "quote": "I believe we can improve our teaching methods by incorporating more technology." },\n  { "quote": "Each of us brings unique skills to the table." }\n]\nEnsure JSON Validity:\n\nAccurate Formatting: Construct the JSON meticulously to avoid syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.\nNo Extraneous Text: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.\nOutput:\n\nSubmit your response as a JSON array containing only the quote for each meaning unit – do not add commentary or any non-JSON text.\n\nMetadata:\n{\n  "id": 1,\n  "title": "Breakthrough in Renewable Energy Technology"\n}\n\nSpeaking Turn:\nIn a significant advancement, scientists at GreenTech Labs have developed a new solar panel that is 30% more efficient than current models.

**Instructions:**

**Code Selection**

1. **Identify Relevant Codes**: For each excerpt, determine all applicable codes from the provided list that accurately describe the content of the excerpt.

2. **Utilize Metadata for Context**: Leverage the provided metadata to gain a comprehensive understanding of the excerpt, ensuring accurate code assignments.

3. **Handle Non-Applicable Excerpts**: If none of the provided codes are relevant to a current excerpt, assign the code "VOID" in the "code_name" field and supply an appropriate justification.

**Provide Justifications**

4. **Explain Code Assignments**: For every assigned code, include a 2-3 sentence justification detailing why the code is pertinent to the CURRENT excerpt (not the context).

5. **Justify "VOID" Assignments**: If "VOID" is assigned, provide a 2-3 sentence explanation clarifying why none of the provided codes are suitable for the current excerpt.

**Formatting Requirements**

6. **JSON Structure**: Format the output as a JSON array where each object corresponds to a single excerpt. Each object should contain the following key:

   - `"codeList"`: An array of code assignments, each comprising:
     - `"code_name"`: The assigned code.
     - `"code_justification"`: The rationale for the code assignment.

7. **Maintain Order**: Ensure that each JSON object aligns with the order of the provided excerpts.

**Ensure JSON Validity**

8. **Accurate Formatting**: Construct the JSON meticulously to avoid syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.

9. **No Extraneous Text**: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.

**Assigning Multiple Codes**

10. **Comprehensive Coding**: Assign all applicable codes to each excerpt; some excerpts may warrant multiple codes.

11. **Use Defined Codes Only**: Restrict assignments to codes explicitly defined in the provided list.

**Example Output Format:**

```json
[
  {
    "codeList": [
      {
        "code_name": "Sample_Code1",
        "code_justification": "This code was applied because the excerpt discusses..."
      },
      {
        "code_name": "Sample_Code2",
        "code_justification": "This code was applied because the excerpt also relates to..."
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "codeList": [
      {
        "code_name": "VOID",
        "code_justification": "No code was applicable as the excerpt does not align with any provided categories."
      }
    ]
  }
]
Contextual Metadata:

You will receive a JSON object containing all relevant metadata for each current excerpt. Use this metadata exclusively as context to inform your code assignments. Do not include any metadata in your output.
You will also recieve context from the conversation in which the current excerpt took place within. Do NOT code for this surrounding context,ONLY  code for the current excerpt.

Output:

Submit your response as a JSON array containing only the codeList for each excerpt – do not add commentary or any non-JSON text.

Each object should contain the following key:\n\n   - `"codeList"`: An array of code assignments, each comprising:\n     - `"code_name"`: The assigned code.\n     - `"code_justification"`: The rationale for the code assignment.\n\n7. **Maintain Order**: Ensure that each JSON object aligns with the order of the provided excerpts.\n\n**Ensure JSON Validity**\n\n8. **Accurate Formatting**: Construct the JSON meticulously to avoid syntax errors such as missing commas, brackets, or braces.\n\n9. **No Extraneous Text**: Do not include any additional text, explanations, or comments outside the JSON code block.\n\n**Assigning Multiple Codes**\n\n10. **Comprehensive Coding**: Assign all applicable codes to each excerpt; some excerpts may warrant multiple codes.\n\n11. **Use Defined Codes Only**: Restrict assignments to codes explicitly defined in the provided list.\n\n**Example Output Format:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    "codeList": [\n      {\n        "code_name": "Sample_Code1",\n        "code_justification": "This code was applied because the excerpt discusses..."\n      },\n      {\n        "code_name": "Sample_Code2",\n        "code_justification": "This code was applied because the excerpt also relates to..."\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    "codeList": [\n      {\n        "code_name": "VOID",\n        "code_justification": "No code was applicable as the excerpt does not align with any provided categories."\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]\nContextual Metadata:\n\nYou will receive a JSON object containing all relevant metadata for each current excerpt. Use this metadata exclusively as context to inform your code assignments. Do not include any metadata in your output.\nYou will also recieve context from the conversation in which the current excerpt took place within. Do NOT code for this surrounding context,ONLY  code for the current excerpt.\n\nOutput:\n\nSubmit your response as a JSON array containing only the codeList for each excerpt – do not add commentary or any non-JSON text.\n\nRelevant Codes (full details):\n{\n  "text": "Innovation",\n  "metadata": {\n    "description": "Introduction of new ideas or methods."\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  "text": "Sustainability",\n  "metadata": {\n    "description": "Focus on long-term environmental and economic viability."\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  "text": "Market Impact",\n  "metadata": {\n    "description": "Effect on market trends and consumer behavior."\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  "text": "Research and Development",\n  "metadata": {\n    "description": "Investigation and creation of new products or knowledge."\n  }\n}\n\n{\n  "text": "Research and Development",\n  "metadata": {\n    "description": "Investigation and creation of new products or knowledge."\n  }\n}\n\nContextual Excerpts:\nQuote: In a significant advancement, scientists at GreenTech Labs have developed a new solar panel that is 30% more efficient than current models.\n\nQuote: This breakthrough promises to revolutionize the renewable energy sector by making solar power more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Important:** Please use the provided contextual excerpts **only** as background information to understand the current excerpt better.
