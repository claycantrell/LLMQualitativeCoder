This is the default parse prompt. Define your text segmentation instructions here. This prompt will be used to break down larger text units into smaller, more focused segments for the main coding task. For example, you could instruct the LLM to identify individual sentences, or short paragraphs, or distinct ideas within the provided text. Each identified segment should be clearly demarcated.
